Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains my first project for a machine learning course, focusing on breast cancer detection.The project involves a comprehensive comparison of several popular machine learning algorithms, evaluating their performance on a breast cancer dataset.
The goal is to identify the most effective algorithm for accurate and reliable predictions.

Key Features:

Preprocessing and exploration of the breast cancer dataset.
Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms, including:

  Decision Trees
  Random Forest
  ANN
  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
  Logistic Regression
  Naive Bayes
  
Performance comparison using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization of results to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
